In this repo, we create a sample scripts to create a heatmap and how to weighted average the WSI.

The sample patch for WSI is 1024. For illustration, we split the patch with a grid of 8.

The general step is to shift the WSI to a target location, then split the WSI based on patch size. For easier follow-up, there will be no overlap. 

# Todo
Adding the sample code to train MxIF to H&E with the idea from Synseg-Net.
